"""
This script reads from stdin line by line and computes the total file size
and the number of lines by status code. After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard
interruption (CTRL + C), it prints the statistics from the beginning.
The input format is `<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1"
<status code> <file size>` and if the format is not this one, the line
is skipped. The possible status codes are 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404,
405 and 500. If a status code doesnâ€™t appear or is not an integer,
nothing is printed for this status code. The status codes are
printed in ascending order.
