## Problem Description:
The "Lockbox Problem" involves a series of locked boxes, each of which may contain keys to other boxes. The challenge is to determine whether **all** boxes can be unlocked starting from the first box (which is always unlocked).

### Key Points:
1. You have `n` boxes numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1`.
2. Each box contains a set of keys, where each key corresponds to a specific box.
3. A key with the same number as a box unlocks that box.
4. The first box (box `0`) is always unlocked, and you begin by accessing the keys inside it.
5. The goal is to determine if all the boxes can be unlocked, using the keys you discover along the way.

## Approach to Solving the Problem:

### 1. **Understand the Initial Conditions:**
   - The first box (`boxes[0]`) is already unlocked.
   - From this box, you will collect keys to potentially unlock other boxes.
   - Other boxes are initially locked and can only be unlocked if you find a corresponding key.

### 2. **Track Unlocked Boxes:**
   - You need a way to keep track of which boxes are unlocked as you collect more keys.
   - Typically, this is done by maintaining a list of boolean values or a set where each element indicates whether a specific box is unlocked (`True` for unlocked, `False` for locked).

### 3. **Iterative Process:**
   - Start with the keys from the first box (`boxes[0]`).
   - For each key, check if it corresponds to a box that hasn’t been unlocked yet.
     - If yes, unlock the box and collect all the new keys from inside that box.
     - Repeat this process for each newly discovered key.

### 4. **Avoid Redundant Work:**
   - You only need to unlock a box once. If you find a key for a box you’ve already unlocked, you can skip it.

### 5. **Termination Condition:**
   - The process continues until either:
     1. All boxes are unlocked.
     2. No new keys are discovered, and there are still locked boxes remaining.

### 6. **Final Check:**
   - At the end, check whether all boxes have been unlocked. If all are unlocked, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

## Example Walkthrough:

### Example 1:
```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
```

- Step 1: Start with box `0` (unlocked) and collect key `1`.
- Step 2: Unlock box `1` and collect key `2`.
- Step 3: Unlock box `2` and collect key `3`.
- Step 4: Unlock box `3` and collect key `4`.
- Step 5: Unlock box `4` (no keys).
- Result: All boxes have been unlocked, so return `True`.

### Example 2:
```python
boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
```

- Step 1: Start with box `0` and collect keys `1`, `4`, `6`.
- Step 2: Unlock box `1` and collect key `2`.
- Step 3: Unlock box `4` and collect key `3`.
- Step 4: Unlock box `6` (no keys).
- Step 5: Unlock box `2` and collect key `0` (already unlocked).
- Step 6: Unlock box `3` and collect key `5`.
- Step 7: Unlock box `5` (no new keys).
- Result: All boxes have been unlocked, so return `True`.

### Example 3:
```python
boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
```

- Step 1: Start with box `0` and collect keys `1`, `4`.
- Step 2: Unlock box `1` and collect key `2`.
- Step 3: Unlock box `4` (no new keys).
- Step 4: Unlock box `2` and collect key `0` (already unlocked).
- Result: Box `3` and box `5` remain locked. Return `False`.

## Time Complexity:
- Each key unlocks a box at most once.
- The time complexity is approximately **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the number of boxes and `m` is the total number of keys.
- In the worst case, we might unlock all boxes and process all the keys.

## Conclusion:
The key to solving the lockbox problem lies in using a systematic approach to collect keys, unlock boxes, and avoid redundant checks. By tracking the status of each box (locked or unlocked) and processing each key efficiently, you can determine whether all boxes can be opened or not.
